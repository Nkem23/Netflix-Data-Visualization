# Netflix-Data-Visualization
This repository contains an analysis of the Netflix dataset using Python and R.
The project covers data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization to uncover insights about Netflix shows and movies.

# Repository Files

# Requirements

Python

R

Libraries needed: Pandas, os, seaborn , matplotlib and ggplot2

# How to Use the Python Script

1. Open Netflix Data with Python .py.txt in an editor (rename to .py if you want to run directly).

2. Run the script in your terminal or Jupyter Notebook:

3. The script performs:

        a. Data cleaning (handling missing values, splitting duration, formatting dates).

       b. Feature engineering (e.g., extracting year added).

       c. Visualizations (e.g., number of titles added per year, ratings distribution).

4. Output: Visualizations are saved as .png files in the repo.


# How to Use the R Script
1. Open Netflix Data with R.r in RStudio or your R environment.

2. Run the script line by line or as a whole.

3. The script performs:

       a. Import the cleaned ataset.

       b. Visualizations using ggplot2.

4. Output: Plots are saved as .png files.

# Datasets

Raw dataset: netflix_data.csv.

Cleaned dataset: Netflix_shows_movies_cleaned.csv (ready for analysis, with missing values handled and new features added).


# Visualizations

The following visualizations are generated:

a. ratings_distribution.png → Ratings distribution (Python)

b. ratings_distribution_R.png → Ratings distribution (R)

c. Top 10 Most Watched Genres on Netflix.png → Popular genres on Netflix


# Interpretation of Data

a. Ratings Distribution: Shows how titles are classified across maturity ratings.

b. Titles Added by Year (Python output) → Reveals growth trends of Netflix content over time.

Top 10 Genres: Identifies the most popular content categories on Netflix.
